    <p>The <a href="http://www.jxd.hk/products.asp?id=639&amp;selectclassid=009006" class="external text" rel="nofollow">JXD S7800</a> is a quad-core, 7-inch Android tablet and portable game console produced by Chinese manufacturer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JXD" class="external text" rel="nofollow">JXD</a>. The device was announced in mid 2013 with the first shipments occurring in mid October. It is available in two models, the S7800A (with an AllWinner A31s SoC) and the S7800B (with a RockChip 3188 SoC and more RAM). The device runs Android 4.2.2.
    </p>
    <p>The JXD S7800 is the successor to the <a href="/index.php?title=Other_Devices:JXD_S7300B" title="Other Devices:JXD S7300B">JXD S7300B</a>. Support from JXD has left some early customers wanting. This page was created to help owners of the device who need some assistance with technical matters. The device is particularly suited to Android gaming and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Retro_gaming" class="external text" rel="nofollow">retro gaming</a> with key mapping.

    <p>The S7800's main improvement over the S7300B is the addition of dual thumb joysticks. A covered microphone, MicroSDHC slot and reset button are found on the bottom left side. Along the top of the top is a power socket, headphone jack, micro usb port and hdmi port. The back of the device can get warm after extended periods of gaming. At half a kilogram the unit is heavy.
